```bash
git clone path/to/your/GitHub/repository
```

### Installing Node



```bash
node -v
```



```bash
$ cd /Users/username/Documents/cd2073-intro-to-js-1-project-starter/starter
```

The path you enter will differ from the above but do note the space between `cd` and the start of the path.

### Install Dependencies

Once in the working directory, you need to add all of the node.js dependencies for the live server and Jest to work. Anytime we download a Node.js project, this is the first step we take.

```bash
npm install
```
